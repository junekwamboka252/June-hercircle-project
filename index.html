            <p>HerCircle was born from a simple but powerful realization that women crave for supportive spaces where they can share their experiences without judgment and also connect. It was Founded by June Kwamboka who has passion of supporting women. HerCircle aims to make that happen The idea sparked during late-night conversations with friends who longed for a trusted community online‚Äîa place to grow, learn, and uplift one another. Today, HerCircle is dedicated to creating a nurturing digital circle that empowers women from all walks of life to share, listen, and thrive together</p>
            <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We provide a nurturing online community where women can share, learn and grow together through mentorships and workshops.</p>
